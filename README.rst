speedtest_reader
================


Selectively read file output generated by speedtest-cli


Description
===========

- Slices data into time frames.

- Keeps data in RAM (append only) to reduce IO (for long-running processes).

- Allows to select subsets of columns / keys (for reading large files).

- Can append additional timestamp types via decorators (for matplotlib,
  plotly, dash).


TODO list (high priorities first)
=================================

- Review API function using mnemonics / shorthand.

- Terminology cleanup in doc and docstrings.

- Complete extended timezone test cases.

- Enable project to use CI (look a travis).

- Backend:

  - Add ability to read json.

  - Extend API to allow selection of input columns (csv) / keys (json).

- Assure compatibility with (at least newer) 2.x Python versions.

- Assure this runs on earlier 3.x versions.
